Python programming challenge
===============================

These exercise are a evidence of my knowledge on Python programming and algorithm design

Challenge are found on the following media

 - [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)
 - [Hola Mundo Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4FHiPgS1KXkUMx3dxBUtPg)
 - [LeetCode In Python: 50 Algorithms Coding Interview Questions](https://www.udemy.com/course/leetcode-in-python-50-algorithms-coding-interview-questions/)


 Some important notes
 ====================
 - Prior of algoritm selection than I learned istrying to check the following order:
    - Mathematic solution (if exist or know)
    - Sort and/or search well-known algoritms
    - Window method: in order to avoid a second checking which could increase the complexity
    - Check list with pointers which checks from the begining and end (try not to modify array)
    - Use hashmap (it will increase complex space but reduce complex time)
    - As last resource, iterate.
