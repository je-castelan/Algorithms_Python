Python programming challenge
===============================

These exercise are a evidence of my knowledge on Python programming and algorithm design

Challenge are found on the following media

 - [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)
 - [Hola Mundo Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4FHiPgS1KXkUMx3dxBUtPg)
 - [LeetCode In Python: 50 Algorithms Coding Interview Questions](https://www.udemy.com/course/leetcode-in-python-50-algorithms-coding-interview-questions/)


 Some important notes
 ====================
 - You can check an array making a `window` in order to avoid a second checking which could increase the complexity
 - It's better to use `pointer` which checks from the begining and end, than modify arrays
