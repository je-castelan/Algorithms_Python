Python programming challenge
===============================

These exercise are a evidence of my knowledge on Python programming and algorithm design

Challenge are found on the following media

 - [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)
 - [Hola Mundo Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4FHiPgS1KXkUMx3dxBUtPg)
 - [LeetCode In Python: 50 Algorithms Coding Interview Questions](https://www.udemy.com/course/leetcode-in-python-50-algorithms-coding-interview-questions/)


# Some important notes
 - Prior of algoritm selection than I learned istrying to check the following order:
    - Mathematic solution (if exist or know)
    - Sort and/or search well-known algoritms
    - Window method: in order to avoid a second checking which could increase the complexity
    - Check list with pointers which checks from the begining and end (try not to modify array)
    - Use hashmap (it will increase complex space but reduce complex time)
    - As last resource, iterate
      - If you don't know how many times iterate, try to use recursive (and also temporaly pointers and variables on the same object in order to not lose control)

There are new kind of data structure than I know in those couses like
- Stack
- Queue
- Graphs
